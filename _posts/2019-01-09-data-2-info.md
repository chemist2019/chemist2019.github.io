##[Turning Data To Information](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/TurningDataToInformation)

This is a self paced workshop to turn data released from Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) into information using open source tools. The purpose of it is to gently walk the user through using different tools with the end result being a web mapping application for finding your nearest GP and seeing the number of doctors, patients and the distance from a location specified.
