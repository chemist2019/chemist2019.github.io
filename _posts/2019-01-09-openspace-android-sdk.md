##[OS OpenSpace Android SDK](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/openspace-android-sdk)

Ordnance Survey OpenSpace Android SDK, an alternative to Google Maps API enabling access to Ordnance Survey data for the UK
The openspace-android-sdk enables access to Ordnance Survey Web Map Tile Services (WMTS) for Android devices. It provides access to a number of mapping layers and gazetteer lookups and has a similar API to Google Maps API v2, so that moving from Google mapping to Ordnance Survey mapping is simple
