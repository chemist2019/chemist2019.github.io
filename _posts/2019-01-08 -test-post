Steve Jones wrote a great article on using this automation here titled [The Demo Setup-Attaching Databases with Powershell](http://bit.ly/2fZNZIG). I threw together a completed script and modified it for my functionality here. MSDN documentation on the functionality is located here [Server.AttachDatabase Method (String, StringCollection, String, AttachOptions)](http://bit.ly/2fZPypU)I see some definitive room for improvement with some future work on this to display percentage complete and so on, but did not implement at this time.
